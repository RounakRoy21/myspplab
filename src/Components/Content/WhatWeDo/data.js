            topic:"Microstructure formation, macro-zone removal of Ti-alloys",
            description:"Objective of the study is to observe microstructure and texture evolution in as-cast and thermo-mechanically processed (rolled, forged and extruded) two-phase Ti-6Al-4V alloys. For that, reconstruction of β-phase from room temperature α-phase was carried out to observe prior β grain morphology and texture. Furthermore, grain boundary α and elemental distribution effect was considered for microstructure and texture formation. In addition, crystallography of the α/β- or α/α-phase interface was noticed for the as-cast and thermo-mechanically processed alloys."

            topic:"High temperature-high strength Al-alloys",
            description:"Aluminium alloys have a heavy amount of usage in aerospace and automotive industry. But the precipitate hardened aluminium alloys have a very limited high temperature performance. Due to precipitate coarsening the mechanical properties of the alloys degrades drastically. In our study we try to engineer the interfacial property of the precipitates in order to stabilize them at high temperature by the means of adding trace amount of alloying elements. Both cas and wrought aluminium alloys are studies in greater details for development of new alloy systems. State of the art simulation techniques and diffusion based studies are also done to support the experimental works."

            topic:"Machinable glass ceramics",
            description:"Glass-ceramics is a unique type of materials which contains randomly oriented crystals in glass matrix. Mica glass-ceramics shows good machiniability and can be made in complex shapes like metals. These materials are used in Aero-space/space applications. In our study, Microstructure development and mechanical properties of Mica machinable glass ceramics are observed by varying processing parameters like temperature, heating rate, composition etc. using different characterization techniques like XRD, SEM, TEM, EBSD and fracture test."

            topic:"Shear band formation",
            description:"During plastic deformation, a strong inhomogeneity occurs in metals and alloys by virtue of thermomechanical instability. Therefore, a strong localization of strain is observed due to inherent crystal anisotropy of polycrystalline materials and geometrical restrictions like grain and phase boundaries. This localization of plastic strain results into formation of shear bands in materials and most often leads to catastrophic failure by intensely localized shearing. In our study we explore the formation mechanism of shear band and their effect on the mechanical property for different materials with different crystal structure and crystallographic properites."

            topic:"Additive manufacturing",
            description:"Laser metal deposited stainless steel (17-4 Ar PH and 316L) and WSU 100 (a Ni-based superalloy) systems are extensively studied. To date, the effect of extensive thermal cycles in the as-deposited specimens has been studied via various methods. It includes microstructure-based characterizations (OM, SEM, quantification with EBSD and XRD, etc.) and mechanical testing (micro-hardness, etc.). In addition, the porosities were identified and analyzed with the help of X-ray micro-CT. Currently, heat treatment and high temperature-based studies are going on in these systems and will be further compared from the as-deposited ones."

            topic:"Carbon fiber reinforced Ultra high temperature ceramic composite",
            description:"Ultra-high temperature applicability has made carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide (C-SiC) composites, a potential solution in the field of aerospace. C-SiC composite is a thermo-structural material which has excellent thermal shock resistance, erosion and oxidation resistance properties. Because of its high fracture toughness and damage tolerability, it is considered as appropriate candidate for structural applications.3D nonwoven needle punched Carbon fiber reinforced Silicon Carbide (C-SiC) composites were synthesized by liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) method. The microstructure, mechanical, chemical, ablation (by plasma arc jet testing) and thermal properties are being investigated in our study."
